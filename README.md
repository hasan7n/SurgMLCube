# SurgMLCube
Benchmarking machine learning models on surgical videos
This Folder contains three MLCubes:
  * surg_prep: A data preparation MLCube of surgical videos datasets annotated with surgical phases.
  * surg_model_TeCNO: A model MLCube for running inference on surgical videos datasets for the task of surgical phase recognition using [TeCNO](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59716-0_33) model.
  * surg_metrics: A metrics MLCube for evaluating Frame-wise video classification models.
