need to provide path to:
    videos
        as an input:
        - fps?
        - image dimentions?
        - rgb or blackwhite?
        - video codecs: mp4, webm, ....
        - videos names?

        as an output:
        - npy? npz?
        - pngs images?
        - tfrecords?
        - rgb bgr?


    labels file (phase annotations for now. this should be extended to: tools, action triplets, segmentation labels, etc...)
        - json file format?
        - txt file format? csv?
        - timestamps or frames IDs?
        - which file is for which video? how is this established?


- use python-ffmpeg instead of ffmpeg?
- compare runtime with opencv
- make frame extraction as a seperate task? e.g. data given as already extracted images
- if the provided labels were in the format: frame_ID, label. should we allow the user to specify as a parameter:
    do the frame IDs correspond to the video state after sampling or before sampling?
    also, should it be starting with frame_ID=0 or 1?

- outofbody labels?
- show explicitly missing labels if they exist?
- more explicit sanity checks maybe are needed
- labels oversampled?
